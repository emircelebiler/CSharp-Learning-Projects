This repository includes small C# projects I developed to practice and reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned.
## Projects

### Mini ATM
- A basic ATM simulation built with C#.

More will be added as I go.
### BMI Calculator
- This console application calculates Body Mass Index (BMI).
- It asks for the user's weight (kg) and height (m).
- Then, it returns the BMI value and categorizes it (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
